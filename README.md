# Machine Learning From Scratch
This my collection of Machine Learning codes that I wrote from scratch using only `numpy`(and sometimes `sklearn` for
importing dataset and `matpotlib` for visualization.).

I started writing these codes for some basic Machine Learning algorithm to develop my skill as a coder and also to learn the
basics of ML. I'm not so sure how far along the way of learning curve I'm right now.

Feel free to to create issues if you think something's wrong with these codes(and I'm certain that there are plenty
of them.).

# Requirements
    1. Numpy
    2. Sklearn
    3. Matplotlib

# Data
I used the infamous [mnist](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset for training and testing in most of the cases. You can easily
load it using `sklearn`. I've also put the dataset in `mldata`
folder from where you can load it too. Also, I found a [bangla handwritten
digit dataset](https://github.com/manashmndl/BanglaMNIST) and trained my model on it too.
